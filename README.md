A portfolio of my web, iOS and Android projects over the years.

## Starting Web Server
Before starting the server, first activate a virtual environment by entering `./env/scripts/activate` in your command line. 
Once activated, go into the "src" folder by entering `cd src` and enter `python manage.py runserver` into the command line. Once complete, look in the command line for the URL the server is being run at, usually its http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
